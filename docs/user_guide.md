## Orientation
![Orientaton](screenshots/CiS_Orientation.png "Orientation")

The Model Composer UI consists of several smaller components:
* Navbar
* Canvas (aka "The Graph")

The *Navbar* runs along the top of the UI and contains the Crops _in silico_ brand name and logo. On the left side, you will find a link to submit a new model. On the right side, you will also find the `Log In` button and a `Help` dropdown which contains links to this user guide, the developer's guide, and the documentation for the `cisrun` CLI tool.

The *Canvas* is the grid with the black background in the center of the screen. This displays the current state of the graph that the user is working on. 

In front of the Canvas, there are also a few helpful floating windows:
* Model Library (aka "Palette")
* Button Bar
* Context Menu + Edit Sidebar

The *Model Library* starts collapsed, and can be found on the top-left of the canvas. This consists of a simple table listing of the existing models that the system knows about. Here we can also add InPorts and OutPorts to our graph. Simply click the `Add` (+) button and the new node will appear in the Canvas. If the node appears off-screen, you can easily find it by pressing the `F` key to focus on the entire graph. For models that you have created, here you can also find the option to delete them (see [Creating a New Model](user_guide.md#creating-a-new-model)).

![Expanded Model Palette](screenshots/CiS_Expanded_Model_Palette.png "Expanded Model Palette")

The *Button Bar* runs along the top-right of the canvas. It contains actions such as `Save`, `Load`, `Clear`, and `Generate Manifest`. `Save` will store the state of your current graph to the database, while `Load` will import a given state from the database. `Clear` will remove all nodes and edges from the current canvas, but does not affect graphs that have been stored in the database. `Generate Manifest` will convert the current graph on the canvas to the format that is required by the `cisrun` CLI.

The *Context Menu* appears when an entity in the canvas is right-clicked. It appears as a round menu that centers on where the mouse click occurred. `Edit` and `Delete` are offered the only actions offered, and only when right-clicking on Edges or Nodes (including InPorts and OutPorts).

If `Edit` is chosen, the Edit Sidebar will be displayed on the right edge of the canvas. The sidebar allows you to edit the metadata of the entity you have selected. This sidebar will also appear when adding an InPort or OutPort to specify the source/destination of the data.

## Canvas Controls
The Canvas accepts a few mouse/keyboard inputs:
* `F`: Auto-focus the graph so that you can see all elements
* `Left-click`: Select a port on a node
* `Left-click (hold)`: Drag a node around the canvas
* `Right-click`: Display the context-menu for the clicked graph element

## Loading an Example Graph
The Button Bar at the top-right should offer a `Load` button. Clicking on this button will expand a dropdown list of all saved graphs and examples currently accessible. Choosing one of these examples will load its contents into your Canvas, allowing you to visualize and edit the graph before generating a manifest for use with `cisrun`.

## Adding a Node
The Model Library on the left side offers an "Add" button beside each model. Click this button to add a new node to the canvas representing the model you've chosen. Once added, you can left-click this node and hold to drag it around the  canvas. On the new node, you should see grey dots on the left/right sides - these are the inputs (left side) and outputs (right side) that this model accepts.

For more details, see the documentation for [Model file input/output](https://cropsinsilico.github.io/cis_interface/getting_started.html#model-file-input-output)

### About the Bounding Box
While dragging, you may notice a lighter gray circle around the dragged node. This is the "bounding box" that indicates valid areas where your node can be dragged - as your node moves the bounding box moves with it! This behavior is meant to prevent you from dragging a node so fast that the mouse cursor exits the node before the "drag" event is picked up.

## Adding an Edge
To create an edge, simply click on an output on a model - this should display a floating edge that ends at your cursor. Then, select an input on  another model. You can also choose an input first and connect that to an output.

NOTE: Inputs can only be connected to outputs and vice versa. An input cannot be connected to another input. An output cannot be connected with another output.

For more details, see the documentation for [Model-to-model communication](https://cropsinsilico.github.io/cis_interface/getting_started.html#model-to-model-communication-with-connections)

## Adding an InPort / OutPort
While each node has its own set of inputs and outputs, the entire graph likely will need InPorts/OutPorts of its own. The Model Palette at the left of the view offers buttons to add these InPorts and OutPorts.

## Right-Click Context Menu
In general, right-clicking an entity on the canvas will bring up a context menu for the clicked object. We currently support right-click operations on Nodes, InPorts/OutPorts, and Edges.

### Nodes
Right-clicking a node will bring up the context menu, and allows you to `Delete` the node or `Edit` its metadata:
* Label (optional): The identifier for this node that will appear in the canvas

You should also see the model inputs/ouputs displayed with the context menu open. Just to the left of the context menu, you should see any inputs offered by this node. To the right, you will see its outputs. This allows you to easily select an input or output and connect it to another model.

### InPorts / OutPorts
Right-clicking an InPort or OutPort will bring up the context menu, and allows you to delete it or edit its metadata:
* Label (optional): The identifier for this node that will appear in the canvas
* Type (required): The type of this port - this can be either "File" or "Queue" (if using AMQP queues)
* Value (required): The value of this port - this will either be a filepath (for Type=File) or a queue name (for Type=Queue)
* Read/Write Method (optional): how are the contents formatted? can be any of 'table', 'table_array', 'pandas' or 'line'

### Edges
Right-clicking an edge will bring up the context menu, and allows you to delete the edge or edit its metadata:
* Label (optional): A friendly identifier for this edge (currently unused)
* Field Names (optional): If this edge contains multiple fields, you can specify their names as a comma-separated list of values
* Field Units (optional): If this edge contains multiple fields, you can specify their units as a comma-separated list of values

## Logging In
For users who simply wish to build new graphs from our existing sets of models, we do not require them to create an account or log into the system. Anyone who wishes to Create a New Model or Save a Composed Graph to the database, however, will need to sign up for an account. This is simply to track which users created which models, to avoid showing unvetted or defunct options to all users.

To begin the login process, click `Log In` at the top-right in the Navbar:

![OAuth Start](screenshots/CiS_OAuth_Start.png "OAuth Start")

You will then be prompted for your GitHub account credentials. If you do not already have a GitHub account, you can [sign up for one for free on GitHub.com](https://github.com/join?source=header-home)

![OAuth Authentication](screenshots/CiS_OAuth_Login.png "OAuth Authentication")

After signing in, you will be asked to Authorize the Crops _in silico_ Platform to access your GitHub account information. We only examine your user profile information and use it to create al inked account in our system.

![OAuth Authorization](screenshots/CiS_OAuth_Authorize.png "OAuth Authorization")

Click "Authorize" to be redirected the Crops _in silico_ application. You are now logged in as your GitHub user, and should see a couple of new buttons have appeared in the User Interface:
* Save Graph
* Submit a New Model

![OAuth Authorized](screenshots/CiS_OAuth_End.png "OAuth Authorized")

## Saving a Composed Graph
After logging in, the Button Bar will include a `Save` button. Clicking this button will offer you a prompt to name this graph. If a valid name is entered, the graph will be saved to the database.

### Loading a Previously-Saved Graph
After a graph has been saved, it should appear in the `Load` dropdown on the Button Bar. Choosing a previously-saved graph will load its contents into the Canvas.

NOTE: In order to facilitate composing different models and examples, `Load` does not Clear your existing graph state.

### Deleting a Previously-Saved Graph
For graphs that you have saved, you should see a `Delete` button beside them. Simply click this button to remove the saved graph from the database.

## Creating a New Model
Do you have a new model that you would like to contribute? After logging in, the Navbar offers a link that will allow you to submit your own custom model metadata. Simply `Log In` at the top-right, then click `Submit a New Model` at the top-left. A pop-up should appear allowing you to enter all necessary metadata fields of you model. Once created, your model appears in your personal catalog for testing and debugging.

### Deleting a Model
If you have created a model that you would like to remove, you should see a `Delete` button listed on the Model Palette once when it is expanded. Click the search icon to expand the Model Palette. You should see a red `Delete` button beside any unofficial specs that you have created.

NOTE: Once a model or graph has been officially submitted, it cannot be deleted

## Official Submission
When you are satisfied with the working state of your model or graph, you can submit it to our official catalog as an issue or pull request to the [cis-specs](https://github.com/cropsinsilico/cis-specs) repository. Here it will go through a peer review process where it will be testing and vetted. If it passes the review, it will be accepted into our official catalog, where all users will be able to consume and use the new model.

We are working to automate this submission process further, and we thank you for your patience while we determine the best course of action.
